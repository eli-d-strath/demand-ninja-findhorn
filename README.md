# Demand.ninja

The Demand.ninja model delivers an hourly time-series of energy demand for a given location, for your chosen temperature thresholds and BAIT (building-adjusted internal temperature) parameters which describe the characteristics of a building and its occupants.

This code also runs online on the [Renewables.ninja service](https://www.renewables.ninja/).

## Example use

```python

import demand_ninja

# `inputs` has to be a pandas.DataFrame with four columns,
# humidity, radiation_global_horizontal, temperature,
# and wind_speed_2m
inputs = pd.DataFrame(...)

# `result`` will be a pandas.DataFrame
# setting raw=True includes the input data and intermediate results
# in the final DataFrame
result = demand_ninja.demand(inputs, raw=True)

```
